# XcodeGen – Capabilities (One-Liners)

- Generates `.xcodeproj` from a declarative spec (YAML / JSON / Plist).
- Makes Xcode projects deterministic, reproducible, and reviewable.
- Eliminates manual `.xcodeproj` editing for day-to-day project maintenance.
- Treats the Xcode project as generated, disposable output (regenerate anytime).
- Supports Apple platforms (iOS, macOS, tvOS, watchOS, and visionOS).
- Supports many Xcode target/product types (apps, frameworks, static libs, extensions, tests, etc.).
- Enables multi-target project generation from a single spec.
- Supports modular/multi-module setups (multiple targets/frameworks within one workspace/project).
- Allows defining custom build configurations (e.g., Debug, Release, Staging).
- Supports global, per-target, and per-configuration build settings.
- Integrates with `.xcconfig` files for layered configuration.
- Manages sources (and file grouping) declaratively.
- Supports resources like asset catalogs, storyboards, xibs, and localized resources.
- Supports Info.plist via file reference and/or declarative plist values (where applicable).
- Supports entitlements configuration (per target/config where needed).
- Supports adding build phases (Run Script, Copy Files, custom phases).
- Supports pre-build and post-build scripting via build phases.
- Supports clean modeling of internal target dependencies.
- Supports linking system frameworks and external libraries/frameworks.
- Integrates with Swift Package Manager dependencies (as supported by Xcode/XcodeGen).
- Generates and manages schemes (shared/user) from the spec.
- Fully configures scheme actions (build, test, run, profile, analyze, archive).
- Supports scheme launch arguments and environment variables.
- Supports unit tests and UI tests wiring in schemes.
- Works well in CI/CD (generate the project as part of the pipeline).
- Produces diff-friendly project definitions that reduce merge conflicts.
- Scales for teams and larger repos by centralizing configuration as code.
- Improves onboarding by making setup consistent and automated.
